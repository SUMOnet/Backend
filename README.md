## Setting up the environment

To use the necessary dependencies, we need to set up the virtual environment.

### For Windows users

Write the following line to the terminal: `python -m venv env`

### For Unix/macOS users

Write the following line to the console: `python3 -m venv env`

## Activating the virtual environment

To install our dependencies, we need to activate the virtual environment. (You must be in the same directory with the env folder. You can check that up from terminal.)

### For Windows users

Write the following line to the terminal: `python -m venv env`

### For Unix/macOS users

Write the following line to the console: `source env/bin/activate`

## Installing the dependencies

After you set up the virtual environment and activate it, you have to install the necessary dependencies below:

- django
- djangorestframework
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- tensorflow
- keras
- requests
- biopython
- loguru

To install all of the dependencies, write the following line to the console: ` **pip install django djangorestframework numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib tensorflow keras requests biopython loguru**`
